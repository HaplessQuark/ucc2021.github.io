To learn more about Git/GitHub, see the [tech talk NetSoc did](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KTJEECNd6m2vgqf4-B6z8pcmQ2TossFWszD-Il6-2fg/edit#slide=id.p), and also take a look at [GitHub's own getting started guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

Once you're up to speed on Git and GitHub, fork this repository, make your changes, and send in a pull request. Or if you haven't the time, open an issue.

## Contact

If anything needs explaining, shoot me an email. You'll also (hopefully) find me at a lecture, pop up and talk!
